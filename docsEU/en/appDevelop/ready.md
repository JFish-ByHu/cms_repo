# Overview of App Data Communication 

## Background

After your device accesses Developer Center, the App can use Websocket and OpenAPI for message communication. See the following flow chart for details.

The App can use the SDK provided by the Platform, or call the Platform's OpenAPI to control your device(s) remotely. For API details, see [OpenAPI User Guide](/appDevelop/OpenAPI/API_accessInstruction).

Through WebSocket, the App interacts with the device(s) in real time and receives messages from the device(s), adjusts device parameters, and performs other functions.
