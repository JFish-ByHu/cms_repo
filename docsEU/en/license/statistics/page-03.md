# Usage Monitoring â€“ Service Subscription

This section introduces the calculation rule and how to view the data of service subscriptions on Developer Center.

**Note: A new billing mechanism will be operated on Developer Center from July 2025.**

## Service Subscription Description

The number of service subscriptions only counts the number of messages that SaaS applications subscribe to AMQP from the paid queue.

Each SaaS application can create only 1 free message queue.

If you have additional requirements, you can create paid queues.

Navigation: "**SaaS Development**" > Select a SaaS application in "**SaaS Management**" > "**Message Subscription**" > "**Message** **Queue**".

**Note: Please purchase service subscription resource packages before using paid queues. When the service subscription top-up balance reaches 0, paid queues will stop receiving push messages.**

**Remaining Service Subscriptions in Top-up Packages**

This section displays the remaining quantity of device service subscriptions in top-up packages purchased under the account.

<br />
1. Resource top-up packages under the account can be used by all applications within the account.

2. When the account has remaining service subscriptions in top-up packages, paid queues created under the account can continue to subscribe to AMQP messages, and the usage will be directly deducted from the top-up package.

3. When the top-up package balance reaches 0, paid queues will stop receiving push messages.

**Therefore, if you have created paid queues as needed, please make sure to purchase a top-up package in advance to maintain sufficient balance for the normal operation of your business.**
